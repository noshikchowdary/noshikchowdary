> “A leap of faith” is how many great journeys begin — mine led me to data.

I’m a **Data Engineer & Analyst** with 3+ years transforming raw data into scalable, cloud‑native pipelines and actionable insights. I specialize in:

- **Real‑time ELT** (AWS Glue, Airflow, dbt)  
- **Data modeling & BI** (Snowflake, Databricks, Tableau, Power BI)  
- **AI/ML pipelines** (Lambda, MLflow, Streamlit)  

At the intersection of software engineering and analytics, I build reliable systems that empower teams and drive business impact
